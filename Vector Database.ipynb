    "`Proprietary AI models`, such as those offered by **OpenAI** and similar vendors, have played a significant role in accelerating the adoption of large-scale language and multimodal systems. However, relying on closed, hosted models introduces several structural drawbacks that become increasingly relevant as AI systems move from experimentation to production. **First**, proprietary models operate as black boxes: their architectures, training data, and optimization strategies are not fully disclosed. This limits transparency, makes debugging and auditing difficult, and creates challenges for compliance, reproducibility, and long-term maintainability. **Second**, usage is typically bound to external APIs, introducing latency, availability dependencies, and vendor lock-in. Cost can also scale unpredictably with usage, making budgeting and optimization harder at scale. **Finally**, data privacy and governance constraints may prevent sensitive or regulated data from being processed by third-party services altogether."
